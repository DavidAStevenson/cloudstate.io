    <p>State handling in a serverless world</p>

    <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

    <p>Serverless computing makes developers more productive by taking care
    of operational concerns for them.</p>

    <p>However, serverless functions fail to address the challenges associated
    with managing state.</p>

    <p>CloudState sits at the confluence between serverless and state, making
    developers more productive by handling the operational and distribution
    concerns of state for them.</p>

    <p>Jonas Bon√©r, CTO and co-founder of <a
                                           href="https://www.lightbend.com">Lightbend</a>
    and creator of <a href="https://akka.io">Akka</a>, talks about the need
    for serverless to evolve to handle state at KubeCon Barcelona 2019:</p>

        <dd>Scale services intelligently and provide in depth

    </dl>
   
    <p>CloudState is an architectural approach and implementation of that
    approach for providing distributed state management patterns suitable for
    serverless computing. Current supported and envisioned patterns
    include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Event Sourcing</li>
        <li>CRDTs</li>
        <li>P2P messaging</li>
        <li>CQRS read side projections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>CloudState services can be written in any language that supports gRPC,
    with language specific libraries provided that allow idiomatic use of the
    patterns in each language. CloudState can be used either by itself, in
    combination with a service mesh, or it is in envisioned that it will
    be integrated with other serverless technologies such as 
    <a href="https://knative.dev">Knative</a>.</p>
