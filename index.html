			<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

			<p>Serverless computing makes developers more productive by taking care of operational concerns for them.</p>

			<p>However, serverless functions fail to address the challenges associated with managing state.</p>

			<p>CloudState sits at the confluence between serverless and state, making developers more productive by handling the operational and distribution concerns of state for them.</p>

			<p>Jonas Bon√©r, CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.lightbend.com">Lightbend</a> and creator of <a href="https://akka.io">Akka</a>, talks about the need for serverless to evolve to handle state at KubeCon Barcelona 2019:</p>

			<h3 id="what">What?</h3>

			<!-- This would be nice if each list item was paired with a graphic -->
			<dl>
				<dt>State</dt>
				<dd>Provide distributed state management patterns that ensure scalability and reslience.</dd>
				<dt>Operations</dt>
				<dd>Scale services intelligently and provide in depth observability.</dd>
				<dt>Productivity</dt>
				<dd>Allow developers to focus on their domain problem, rather than how state is managed.</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>CloudState is an architectural approach and implementation of that approach for providing distributed state management patterns suitable for serverless computing. Current supported and envisioned patterns include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Event Sourcing</li>
				<li>CRDTs</li>
				<li>P2P messaging</li>
				<li>CQRS read side projections</li>
			</ul>

			<p>CloudState services can be written in any language that supports gRPC, with language specific libraries provided that allow idiomatic use of the patterns in each language. CloudState can be used either by itself, in combination with a service mesh, or it is in envisioned that it will be integrated with other serverless technologies such as <a href="https://knative.dev">Knative</a>.</p>
