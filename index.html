    <p>State handling in a serverless world</p>

    <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

    <p>Serverless computing makes developers more productive by taking care
    of operational concerns for them.</p>

    <p>However, serverless functions fail to address the challenges associated
    with managing state.</p>

    <p>CloudState sits at the confluence between serverless and state, making
    developers more productive by handling the operational and distribution
    concerns of state for them.</p>

    <p>Jonas Bon√©r, CTO and co-founder of <a
                                           href="https://www.lightbend.com">Lightbend</a>
    and creator of <a href="https://akka.io">Akka</a>, talks about the need
    for serverless to evolve to handle state at KubeCon Barcelona 2019:</p>

    <h2 id="what">What?</h2>
    
    <p>CloudState provides an architectural approach and associated protocol
    for providing common distributed state management patterns. There are no
    limits on which patterns can be supported, however current and envisioned
    supported patterns include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Event Sourcing</li>
        <li>CRDTs</li>
        <li>P2P messaging</li>
        <li>CQRS read side projections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A sidecar is provided that handles all incoming communication, as well
    as communiaction to other services and databases. The sidecar is also
    responsible for concerns such as clustering, sharding, P2P messaging, and
    replication.</p>

    <p>The protocol allows the multiplexing of state and incoming
    communication on the same channel, allowing developers to focus only on
    their business logic, and not how state is managed, distributed, and
    stored.</p>

    <p>The sidecars have an intimate understanding of the state management
    patterns being used, and consequently are able to apply intelligent
    autoscaling based on that knowledge, and are able to give in depth
    observabiility into exactly what is happening.</p>

    <p>CloudState can be used either by itself, in combination with a service
    mesh, or it is in envisioned that it will integrated with other serverless
    technologies such as <a href="https://knative.dev">Knative</a>.</p>
